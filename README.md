This project contains a couple of custom plug-ins for Specflow

### NLogTracer.Generator.SpecflowPlugin 
 Directs Specflow to delegate logging to the Nlog logging library


### MTMGeneratorProvider.Generator.SpecFlowPlugin 
  If using MsTest with Specflow, this plugin customises the MSTest unit tests generated by Specflow in the following ways:
 
* Adds access to the MsTest Test Context via the Specflow feature context.
* Scans your specflow scenarios for tags in the format _@workitem:123456_ and then builds a MSTest datasource attribute for these tests, linked to a MTM test case within Team Foundation server with that ID.

For example:   
_[TestMethod, DataSource("Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.DataSource.TestCase", "http://tfs-win2012:8080/tfs/StuCollection;SpecflowDemo, "123456", DataAccessMethod.Sequential)]_

Together, these features allow you to write tests in Specflow which link to MTM test cases and can access the test data defined within them.
